Here are some methods to determine the directory location of a Bash script during its execution:

1. Using `$0` and `dirname`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
script_dir=$(dirname "$0")
echo "Script directory: $script_dir"
```

2. Using `$BASH_SOURCE`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
script_dir=$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")
echo "Script directory: $script_dir"
```

3. Using `readlink` to handle symbolic links:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
script_dir=$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")
echo "Script directory: $script_dir"
```

4. Combining `cd`, `pwd`, and `$0`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
script_dir="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
echo "Script directory: $script_dir"
```

Each of these methods can be used to reliably determine the directory location of the executing Bash script.
