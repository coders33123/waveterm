You’re referencing a devcontainer.json snippet used with Visual Studio Code Dev Containers. That image line:

"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/universal:2"

…means you’re using the universal base image from Microsoft’s dev container library, which includes a bunch of pre-installed developer tools (Node.js, Python, Git, etc.).

What This Image Includes

mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/universal:2 is a pre-configured all-in-one development image, good for:
	•	Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js
	•	Docker CLI
	•	Git, curl, wget, zsh, and common Linux tools
	•	VS Code remote extensions

Tips & Tricks for Dev Containers
	1.	Add Features (e.g., Jupyter, Docker-in-Docker, Poetry):

"features": {
  "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {
    "version": "3.11"
  },
  "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/jupyterlab:1": {}
}


	2.	Custom Post-Start Commands:
Add in your devcontainer.json:

"postStartCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"


	3.	Mount local folders/data using volumes in docker-compose.yml if you’re running it that way.
	4.	Auto-run Jupyter on container start:
Add a script like:

jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --NotebookApp.token=''


	5.	Access Jupyter from browser:
Use localhost:8888 or 127.0.0.1:8888 if forwarded correctly by VS Code.
